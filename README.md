# UTPB-COSC-4490-Project2
This repo contains the assignment and provided code base for Project 2 of the Introduction to Game Development class.

The provided classes (main is in Game.java) contain a very bad implementation of Flappy Bird in Java.

Using the provided engine as a basis, create a game.  The requirements for the game are:
0) All requirements from project 1.
1) Some art representing the player, the environment, and any enemies.
2) It must play at least one audio file as an indicator of some condition.
3) The user must be capable of pausing, resetting, and quitting the game through use of an in-game menu.
4) There should be a toggle-able debug mode accessible to the player which turns on display of stats like the current FPS and UPS, the current frame and update counters, all hitboxes, and any other relevant debugging information.

The grading criteria is:
* If the code fails to execute, the grade is zero.
* If the code experiences an unhandled exception in normal play, the grade is zero.
* If the project meets the above requirements, that counts as 100%.
* Partial satisfaction of the requirements will result in a grade between 0 and 100.

Keep in mind that future projects will build upon this one, so as long as your final project meets the above requirements the grade for project 2 will be maximized.
